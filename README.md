# Fitness QA Chatbot using T5

##  Project Overview

This repository presents a Fitness Question-Answering generative (QA) Chatbot built using the T5 Transformer model. It leverages a curated dataset of fitness-related QA pairs and applies natural language generation techniques to generate informative and relevant answers. The chatbot is designed for health-conscious individuals, fitness enthusiasts, and those seeking quick guidance about exercise, nutrition, motivation, and more.

## üìÅ Dataset

* **Source**: [HuggingFace Dataset - its-myrto/fitness-question-answers](https://huggingface.co/datasets/its-myrto/fitness-question-answers)
* **Size**: 965 QA pairs (English)
* **Format**: CSV with two main columns: `Question`, `Answer`

### Preprocessing

* Lowercasing, whitespace normalization
* Special character removal
* Filtering fitness-related content using keywords (e.g., "exercise", "nutrition")
* Optional paraphrasing to augment the data (if < 1000 examples)

### Training Pipeline

* Data tokenization with prompt formatting ("Answer this fitness question: ...")
* Supervised fine-tuning using `Trainer` API
* Early stopping (patience: 3 eval steps)
* Logging and loss visualization
